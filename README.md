# Module Introduction

- **automation_linux.py:** Automatically monitors the current number of players and sends a welcome message when new players join. Also responsible for cleaning up dropped items in the world every 30 minutes.

- **command.py:** Provides common commands executed via mcrcon for interaction with the game server.

- **一键开服.bat (One-click Start.bat):** Provides a script for quickly starting the game server. Just modify the name of the core file to start using it.

- **Visualization.py:** Manages the game server intuitively through a visual interface, including functions such as adding players to the whitelist, banning players, and kicking players. This module reads the current player list file for easy selection of players to manage.

- **quickly_command.py:** Provides automation-generated player lists from the server for remote command input, similar to typing commands in the game.

### Additional Files

- **id.txt:** Contains IDs of common items. When executing the command to give items, command.py automatically opens this file to provide a list of items.
